//Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

//Mutability of Collections : If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will be mutable. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection after it‚Äôs created by adding, removing, or changing items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.

//It is good practice to create immutable collections in all cases where the collection does not need to change. Doing so makes it easier for you to reason about your code and enables the Swift compiler to optimize the performance of the collections you create.

//An array stores values of the same type in an ordered list. The same value can appear in an array multiple times at different positions.

//Creating an Empty Array :
var someInts = [Int]() //or
someInts = [] //infers as Int array
//or
var emptyArray = Array<Int>()

//Swift‚Äôs Array type also provides an initializer for creating an array of a certain size with all of its values set to the same default value.
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

//Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double]
var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double]
sixDoubles += anotherThreeDoubles

//Creating an Array with an Array Literal
var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"] // var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// Note - The shoppingList array is declared as a variable (with the var introducer) and not a constant (with the let introducer) because more items are added to the shopping list in the examples below.

//Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:
if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
}

//Appending item to array
shoppingList.append("Flour")
shoppingList += ["Baking Powder", "Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
//shoppingList[shoppingList.count] = "Salt" //run time error
print(shoppingList)

//You can also use subscript syntax to change a range of values at once, even if the replacement set of values has a different length than the range you are replacing.
shoppingList[2...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]// shoppingList now contains 6 items
print(shoppingList)

//To insert an item into the array at a specified index, call the array‚Äôs insert(_:at:) method:
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)

//Similarly, you remove an item from the array with the remove(at:) method.
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
print(mapleSyrup)
print(shoppingList)

//NOTE - If you try to access or modify a value for an index that is outside of an array‚Äôs existing bounds, you will trigger a runtime error.

//Use the removeLast() method rather than the remove(at:) method to avoid the need to query the array‚Äôs count property. Like the remove(at:) method, removeLast() returns the removed item:
let lastItem = shoppingList.removeLast()
print(lastItem)

//If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the enumerated() method to iterate over the array instead.
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}

//Sets : A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items is not important, or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.

//Hashable :

//Creating and Initializing an Empty Set
var letters = Set<Character>()
print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
letters.insert("a")// letters now contains 1 value of type Character
letters = []// letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>

//Creating a Set with an Array Literal
var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items

//A set type cannot be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must be explicitly declared. However, because of Swift‚Äôs type inference, you don‚Äôt have to write the type of the set‚Äôs elements if you‚Äôre initializing it with an array literal that contains values of just one type.
var favoriteGenres1: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]

//Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:
if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
}

//You can add a new item into a set by calling the set‚Äôs insert(_:) method:
favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")

//You can remove an item from a set by calling the set‚Äôs remove(_:) method, which removes the item if it‚Äôs a member of the set, and returns the removed value, or returns nil if the set did not contain it. Alternatively, all items in a set can be removed with its removeAll() method.
if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
    print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
} else {
    print("I never much cared for that.")
}

//To check whether a set contains a particular item, use the contains(_:) method.
if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
    print("I get up on the good foot.")
} else {
    print("It's too funky in here.")
}

//Iterating Over a Set
for genre in favoriteGenres {
    print("\(genre)")
}

Set operations :
Use the intersection(_:) method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.
Use the symmetricDifference(_:) method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.
Use the union(_:) method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.
Use the subtracting(_:) method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

 Set Membership and Equality :
 Use the ‚Äúis equal‚Äù operator (==) to determine whether two sets contain all of the same values.

 Use the isSuperset(of:) method to determine whether a set contains all of the values in a specified set.
 Use the isStrictSubset(of:) or isStrictSuperset(of:) methods to determine whether a set is a subset or superset, but not equal to, a specified set.
 Use the isDisjoint(with:) method to determine whether two sets have no values in common.
