//String Mutability

//Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type. If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it‚Äôs passed to a function or method, or when it‚Äôs assigned to a constant or variable. In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, not the original version.

//You can access the individual Character values for a String by iterating over the string with a for-in loop:
for character in "Dog!üê∂" {
    print(character)
}

//you can create a stand-alone Character constant or variable from a single-character string literal by providing a Character type annotation:
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"

//String values can be constructed by passing an array of Character values as an argument to its initializer:
let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)

//Concatenating Strings
let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2

//You can append a Character value to a String variable with the String type‚Äôs append() method, but you can‚Äôt append a String or Character to an existing Character variable, because a Character value must contain a single character only.:
welcome.append(exclamationMark) // welcome now equals "hello there!"

//String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal.
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"

//You can use extended string delimiters to create strings containing characters that would otherwise be treated as a string interpolation. For example:
print(#"Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."#)// Prints "Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."


//To use string interpolation inside a string that uses extended delimiters, match the number of number signs before the backslash to the number of number signs at the beginning and end of the string. The expressions you write inside parentheses within an interpolated string can‚Äôt contain an unescaped backslash (\), a carriage return, or a line feed. However, they can contain other string literals. For example:
print(#"6 times 7 is \#(6 * 7)."#)// Prints "6 times 7 is 42."

//Count characters in String
print(welcome.count)

//Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string. You can use subscript syntax to access the Character at a particular String index.
let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
greeting[greeting.startIndex]// G
greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)]// !
greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)]// u
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
greeting[index]// a

//Attempting to access an index outside of a string‚Äôs range or a Character at an index outside of a string‚Äôs range will trigger a runtime error.
//greeting[greeting.endIndex] // Error
//greeting.index(after: greeting.endIndex) // Error

//Use the indices property to access all of the indices of individual characters in a string.
for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index]) ", terminator: "")
}

//Note - You can use the startIndex and endIndex properties and the index(before:), index(after:), and index(_:offsetBy:) methods on any type that conforms to the Collection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.

//To insert a single character into a string at a specified index, use the insert(_:at:) method, and to insert the contents of another string at a specified index, use the insert(contentsOf:at:) method.
var welcomeText = "hello"
welcomeText.insert("!", at: welcomeText.endIndex)// welcome now equals "hello!"
welcomeText.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcomeText.index(before: welcomeText.endIndex))// welcome now equals "hello there!"

//To remove a single character from a string at a specified index, use the remove(at:) method, and to remove a substring at a specified range, use the removeSubrange(_:) method:
welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))// welcome now equals "hello there"
let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)// welcome now equals "hello"

//NOTE - You can use the insert(_:at:), insert(contentsOf:at:), remove(at:), and removeSubrange(_:) methods on any type that conforms to the RangeReplaceableCollection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.

//When you get a substring from a string‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_:)‚Äîthe result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String. For example:
let greeting1 = "Hello, world!"
let index1 = greeting1.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting1.endIndex
let beginning = greeting1[..<index1]// beginning is "Hello"
let newString = String(beginning)// Convert the result to a String for long-term storage.
//As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.

//Both String and Substring conform to the StringProtocol protocol

//Comparing Strings : Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: string and character equality, prefix equality, and suffix equality.

//String and Character Equality
let quotation1 = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
let sameQuotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
if quotation1 == sameQuotation {
    print("\nThese two strings are considered equal")// Prints "These two strings are considered equal"
}

//Prefix and Suffix Equality : To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.
if quotation1.hasPrefix("We're") {
    print(quotation1)
}

if sameQuotation.hasSuffix(".") {
    print(sameQuotation)
}

//UTF-8 Representation
let dogString = "Dog‚Äºüê∂"
for codeUnit in dogString.utf8 {//you can use urf16/unicodeScalars also
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")// Prints "68 111 103 226 128 188 240 159 144 182 "
